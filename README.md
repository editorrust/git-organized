## The project planning tool for me
And anyone else who wants to use it too, I guess.

I've tried many project management tools, but there are a few things that make them unusable:
1. Pricing  
  I don't have money to throw at things like monday.com and other of the upper end of these tools. Some of these are actually amazing, with all the necessary features and a clean design, but I just can't pay for them.
2. Features  
  Because of what I do (build whatever I feel like all by myself, doing all the planning, designing, and developing), there are some features that are needed for my work, and some tools just don't have them.
3. Design  
  OK, I know that at this point I'm just being captious. Sometimes, even when a tool is free and has all the needed features, the website design just isn't up to scratch. Codecks is a sad exaple of this, a great tool but the design is not modern enough for me. I'm sorry! I just can't bear using a tool like that. So that's why I'm making my own!
  
So if you want to use or help build this, or want to suggest a feature, email me or somthing.
